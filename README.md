Welcome to my Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development and Social Determinants of Health Research Portfolio! This repository showcases two significant projects that delve into the intersection of public health, data analytics, and technology. In this section for each project I will be explaining the projectâ€™s objectives, the technologies used, challenges faced, and outcomes achieved.

Project 1: Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development:

Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project were to:

Develop a virtual machine environment to simulate multiple healthcare entities, including hospitals and a health information exchange (HIE).
Install and configure OpenEMR, an open-source electronic health record (EHR) system, in each hospital virtual machine.
Generate synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data using Synthea to simulate disease outbreaks across the hospital EHRs.
Install and configure a Hapi-FHIR server for seamless data exchange and integration within the healthcare domain.
Demonstrate interoperability by exchanging HL7 FHIR messages between EHR systems using Hapi-FHIR.

Technologies Used:
Virtualization: VMware Workstation
Operating Systems: Linux distributions (Ubuntu)
Electronic Health Record (EHR) System: OpenEMR
Synthetic Patient Data Generation: Synthea
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Server: Hapi-FHIR

Challenges Faced:
Several challenges were encountered throughout the project, including:
Configuring virtual machine environments with compatible operating systems and networking configurations.
Ensuring the successful installation and configuration of OpenEMR in each hospital virtual machine.
Generating realistic synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data using Synthea to simulate disease outbreaks.
Installing and configuring the Hapi-FHIR server to enable seamless data exchange between healthcare entities.
Implementing and testing interoperability by exchanging HL7 FHIR messages between EHR systems using Hapi-FHIR.

Outcomes Achieved:
Despite the challenges faced, the project successfully achieved the following outcomes:
I was able to develop a virtual machine environment with five virtual machines (four hospitals and one HIE) configured with compatible operating systems and networking configurations. Installed and configured OpenEMR in at least one hospital virtual machine, enabling the storage and exchange of patient data. I Generated synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data using Synthea to simulate disease outbreaks across the hospital EHRs. Installed and configured a Hapi-FHIR server for seamless data exchange and integration within the healthcare domain. I also was able to successfully demonstrate interoperability by exchanging HL7 FHIR messages between EHR systems using Hapi-FHIR.

Personal Contributions:
As the project lead, my contributions included:
Designing the overall architecture of the disease surveillance system.
Configuring virtual machine environments and installing necessary software components.
Troubleshooting technical issues and overcoming challenges encountered during the implementation process.
Collaborating with my instructor to ensure the successful completion of project milestones.

Project 2: Population/Public Health Research Report: 

Tittle: Harnessing Data for Equitable Health: Exploring Social Determinants Through Health Informatics 

Research Question:
This research project delves into the intersection of health informatics and social determinants of health (SDOH) to understand their impact on population health equity. The central research question guiding this exploration is: How can data-driven approaches and informatics solutions inform targeted interventions to promote health equity?

Methodology:
The research methodology in this project encompasses a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) data with qualitative exploration of social determinants through text mining techniques. Data from public sources, clinical records, and social surveys are utilized to develop indices and predictive models for assessing SDOH and their impact on health outcomes. Additionally, informatics maturity models are employed to evaluate the readiness of healthcare systems to address SDOH comprehensively.

Findings:
The findings of this research shed light on the significance of understanding SDOH in advancing health equity. Through the integration of health informatics and SDOH, insights are gained into the complex interplay between social factors and health outcomes. Informatics maturity models facilitate the identification of gaps and opportunities for addressing health disparities effectively. Additionally, big data analytics offer new avenues for understanding and tackling health disparities, informing targeted interventions and decision-making processes.

Personal Contributions:
As the author of this research project, I have created a comprehensive collection of research materials, including a research report detailing the methodology, findings, and implications of the study. Additionally, I have developed presentation materials, including PowerPoint slides, to effectively communicate key findings and insights to diverse audiences. My contributions also extend to creating clear and concise README for this project, effectively communicating the significance of the research, and highlighting my skills in data analysis, and relevant tools and methodologies in health informatics.

Demonstration of Skills:
This research project serves as a testament to my skills in data analysis, and the application of specific tools and methodologies relevant to health informatics. Through detailed research, data collection, and analysis, I have demonstrated proficiency in leveraging data-driven approaches to address complex healthcare challenges and promote health equity. Additionally, my ability to effectively communicate research findings and insights through presentation materials and READMEs underscores my capacity to condense complex information into clear and concise formats.

Project Inclusion:
This project includes the comprehensive research report, presentation materials, and READMEs detailing the research question, methodology, findings, and personal contributions. Through this project, I aim to showcase my expertise in health informatics and highlight the significance of data-driven approaches in addressing health disparities and promoting equitable healthcare outcomes.

Together, these two major projects exemplify my commitment to leveraging technology and data-driven insights to drive positive change in public health and healthcare delivery. I invite you to explore further and discover the innovative solutions and insights presented in this portfolio.
