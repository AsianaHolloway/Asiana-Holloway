Harnessing Data for Equitable Health: Exploring Social Determinants Through Health Informatics 

Research Question:
This research projet delves into the intersection of health informatics and social determinants of health (SDOH) to understand their impact on population health equity. The central research question guiding this exploration is: How can data-driven approaches and informatics solutions inform targeted interventions to promote health equity?

Methodology:
The research methodology in this project encompasses a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) data with qualitative exploration of social determinants through text mining techniques. Data from public sources, clinical records, and social surveys are utilized to develop indices and predictive models for assessing SDOH and their impact on health outcomes. Additionally, informatics maturity models are employed to evaluate the readiness of healthcare systems to address SDOH comprehensively.

Findings:
The findings of this research shed light on the significance of understanding SDOH in advancing health equity. Through the integration of health informatics and SDOH, insights are gained into the complex interplay between social factors and health outcomes. Informatics maturity models facilitate the identification of gaps and opportunities for addressing health disparities effectively. Additionally, big data analytics offer new avenues for understanding and tackling health disparities, informing targeted interventions and decision-making processes.
